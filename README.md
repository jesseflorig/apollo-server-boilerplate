# Apollo Server Boilerplate
A boilerplate project using Apollo server to serve up static data. This project uses Babel to transpile ES6 from `src` to ES5 in `lib`. The structure of the project goes beyond the initial Apollo and Graphql examples to show a more modular project layout. To see how you would connect an Apollo client to this server, check out (Apollo Client Boilerplate)[https://github.com/jesseflorig/apollo-client-boilerplate]

## Running
Clone the project and run `npm start` from the root directory
```
git clone git@github.com:jesseflorig/apollo-server-boilerplate.git
cd apollo-graphql-boilerplate
npm install
npm start
```

## Todo
Some of the improvements pending are:
 - [ ] Add schema/resolver complexity
 - [ ] Add REST api resolvers
 - [ ] Add Mongo sample database
 - [ ] Add SQL sample database
 - [ ] Add tests (?)
